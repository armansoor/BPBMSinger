# YG-GEN ‚Äî K-POP Fan Song Generator

YG-GEN is a web-based application that allows you to generate full-length, member-wise K-POP songs inspired by popular groups like BLACKPINK and BABYMONSTER. The entire process, from lyric generation to audio rendering, happens directly in your browser.

## Features

- **Group Selection**: Choose from predefined K-POP groups (BLACKPINK, BABYMONSTER, (G)I-DLE, Aespa), select a solo artist, or create a custom unit of 2-3 members.
- **Structured Songs**: Generates songs with a complete structure, including Intro, Verses, Pre-Chorus, Chorus, Rap, Bridge, and Outro.
- **Customizable Lyrics**: Select the language for the lyrics: English, Korean, or a mix of both.
- **Adjustable Length**: Choose the approximate duration of the generated song.
- **Live TTS Playback**: Listen to the generated lyrics with Text-to-Speech (TTS) technology, using your browser's available voices.
- **Audio Rendering**: Render the generated song into a downloadable audio file (`.webm`) using a built-in WebAudio synthesizer.
- **Gallery**: Save your favorite creations to a gallery, stored locally in your browser.
- **Selectable Themes**: Switch between two different UI themes: 'YG Official' (a dark, modern theme) and 'Cute Fan' (a light, pastel theme).
